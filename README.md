# 🚨 Capstone: Toronto Auto Theft Analysis Dashboard (2024)

This capstone project leverages Toronto Police open data to analyze rising auto theft trends in the city. The team used Power BI to uncover high-risk neighborhoods, time-based patterns, and premises-related vulnerabilities, helping to inform smarter public safety and resource allocation strategies.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To explore and understand auto theft patterns across Toronto using data-driven visuals and uncover:
- Where thefts happen most frequently
- When they're most likely to occur
- Which types of premises are most vulnerable

## 🔍 Business Problem

Toronto has seen a significant rise in auto thefts. Traditional reporting doesn't offer real-time, actionable insights. Our challenge was to design a dashboard that could help law enforcement and policymakers:
- Identify high-risk neighborhoods and times
- Optimize patrols and public awareness efforts
- Better allocate limited resources
