# 🚨 Toronto Auto Theft Analysis Dashboard

This capstone project leverages Toronto Police open data to analyze rising auto theft trends in the city. The team used Power BI to uncover high-risk neighborhoods, time-based patterns, and premises-related vulnerabilities, helping to inform smarter public safety and resource allocation strategies.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To explore and understand auto theft patterns across Toronto using data-driven visuals and uncover:
- Where thefts happen most frequently
- When they're most likely to occur
- Which types of premises are most vulnerable

---

## 🔍 Business Problem

Toronto has seen a significant rise in auto thefts. Traditional reporting doesn't offer real-time, actionable insights. Our challenge was to design a dashboard that could help law enforcement and policymakers:
- Identify high-risk neighborhoods and times
- Optimize patrols and public awareness efforts
- Better allocate limited resources
